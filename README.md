# 31DaysOfMLProjects

hello, i am challenging myself to work on at least 1 ML project in all the days of AugustðŸŽ‰

each daily project folder would contain a jupyter notebook in `.ipynb` and the dataset in a `.csv` format, i hope to complete beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects (at least 10 each)

currently, i draw most of the project inspiration from [Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/@Siddhardhan)'s playlists on ml projects
